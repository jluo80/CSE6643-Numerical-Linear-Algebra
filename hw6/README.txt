1.p2.m is MATLAB code driver for problem 2.

2.CG.m is MATLAB code for conjugate gradient method.

3.PCG.m is MATLAB code for preconditioned conjugated gradient method.

4.p2.m file is using to call different preconditioner methods and basic CG method.
It will input the specific parameters into the PCG and CG functions. So basically, 
p2.m file acts like a main function.

5.Modify respective parameters that you want, and then directly run the p2.m file.
