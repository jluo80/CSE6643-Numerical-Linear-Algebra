1.Midterm.m is the main function of Problem_5.m.

2.Problem_5.m includes the code for problem 5.

3.If you prefer to get the 10 spectral radius and 10 smallest singular value, 
then uncomment relative part in Problem_5.m file and run Midterm.m file it will 
return those values.

4.If you prefer to see the plot, you can directly run the Problem_5.m file.

5.Problem_2.m file includes the operation of calculating least square problem.
(Not sure if this trivial part should be included, so I just attach here.)
