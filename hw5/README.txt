1.p_2.m is MATLAB code for problem 2(2).

2.p_3.m and method.m is MATLAB code for problem 3.

3.In method.m file, I included all three method algorithms in it.

4.p_3.m file is using to call those three methods and to input some specific parameters.
So basically, p_3.m file acts like a main function.

5.Modify respective parameters that you want, and then directly run the p_3.m file.
